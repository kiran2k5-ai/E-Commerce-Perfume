## 📦 Backend Setup

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend folder and install:

```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
```

The required dependencies are:
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (for JWT authentication)
- cors
- express
- mongoose
- dotenv
- nodemailer
- razorpay

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `src/backend/`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here_change_this_in_production
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd src/backend
npm start
```

## 🎨 Frontend Setup

All frontend dependencies are already in your `package.json`. No new external libraries were added - everything uses Tailwind CSS as requested.

### Existing Dependencies Used:
- React 19.2.0
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Lucide React (icons - already installed)
- Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Start the backend server (from `src/backend`):
```bash
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend (from root):
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔑 Default Admin Account

To create an admin user, you need to manually update a user in MongoDB:

```javascript
// In MongoDB, update a user document:
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "admin@perfume.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)
```

Or register normally and manually change the role in the database.

## 📱 New Routes Added

## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1. User registers → JWT token created
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Token sent with protected API requests
4. Backend verifies token via middleware
5. Access granted/denied based on role

## 💳 Payment Integration

Razorpay is already integrated. Orders are created after successful payment with:
- Order items
- Payment ID
- Shipping address
- Order status tracking

## 📊 Context Providers

Two new contexts manage global state:

1. **AuthContext** - User authentication state
2. **CartContext** - Shopping cart state

Both wrap the entire app in `App.jsx`.

## 🎨 Styling

All components use Tailwind CSS as requested:
- Gradient backgrounds (pink-purple theme)
- Responsive design
- Hover animations
- Clean, modern UI

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start:
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify .env file exists
- Install all dependencies

### Login/Register not working:
- Ensure backend is running
- Check API endpoints match
- Verify CORS is enabled

### Cart not persisting:
- Check browser localStorage
- Clear localStorage if needed

### Admin panel not accessible:
- Verify user role is "admin" in database
- Check JWT token is valid

## 📝 Notes

- No new npm packages were added to frontend (only used existing ones)
- All styling done with Tailwind CSS
- Backend requires new packages: bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken
- JWT secret should be changed in production
- MongoDB connection required

- Complete authentication system
- AI chatbot
- Wishlist & reviews
- Multi-item cart
